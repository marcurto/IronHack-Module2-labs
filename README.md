# IronHack Labs | Module 2

Practices done during the Module 2 of Web Development Bootcamp at IronHack.



### Module 2: The back-end

In Module 2 we learned how to create a server and discovered the intricacies of data modeling. We learned NodeJS, ExpressJS, Handlebars, MongoDB and Mongoose.



### Labs description

- *MongoDB - Advanced Querying*: Using query operators for practicing how to retrieve the data from a database.

- Intro *Node*: Practicing some basic Node.js operations and software testing using Mocha.

- *Express Basic Site*: Creating a basic web with Home, About, Works and Gallery pages using Express.js.

- *IronBeers*: Practicing Handlebars layouts and partials using PunkAPI npm package.

- *Mongoose Recipes*: Practicing Schemas and the interaction with a MongoDB database using different Mongoose methods.

- *Express Spotify*: Building an Express app to search Spotify for artists, albums and tracks and being able to preview of some of these songs using "spotify-web-api-node" npm package. We practiced how to use the GET method, req.query and req.params. Also we practiced how to read documentation of the npm package and using the examples provided by the docs.

- *Mongoose Movies*: Creating an Express app with all the basic CRUD (create, read, update and delete) actions using two different Models. We practiced how to use GET and POST methods interacting with a self-created database using seeds.js.

- *Express basic auth*: Practicing how to create basic authorization and authentication in a web app with sign up, login, protected routes and some validations.

- *Codealong - Uber for Laundry*: Practicing how to add user authentication to an Express application using tokens, store user information, use it in some routes and prevent anonymous (logged out) users from accessing parts of our application.

### Associated project

In week 6 begins the Module 2 project, which we do in pairs, and that we named **At Once**. We combine all the technologies learned and create a full-stack web application using Express.js as a foundation and Mongoose for models and database communication. The web have some validations on its models, includes sign up, log in and log out functionalities with encrypted passwords and authorization and supports two types of users. Also have routes for Create, Read, Update and Delete (CRUD) features for the different models. You can check the deploy on Heroku [here](https://projecte2ih.herokuapp.com/), or the entire code on [GitHub repository](https://github.com/marcurto/Project_2).
